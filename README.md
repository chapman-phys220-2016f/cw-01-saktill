[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2016f/cw-01-saktill.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2016f/cw-01-saktill)

## Specification

Complete the following exercises, saving your solutions in the indicated files. For Python files that include test functions, GitHub will automatically run your tests with ```nosetests``` on every commit, indicating any failures via the Travis framework in the build status image above.

1. Using ```vim``` in a terminal, create a ```bash``` script named ```mktmpfiles.sh``` that, when executed, creates a new directory ```testfiles``` in the current working directory, then changes the working directory to the newly created directory, then creates 100 empty new files named ```file001.tmp``` through ```file100.tmp```, then changes the working directory back to the original directory. Commit only the file ```mktmpfiles.sh``` to GitHub.
1. Using ```vim``` in a terminal, create a LaTeX file ```testlatex.tex``` (using the template in the ```info``` repository). In this file write an explanation of what the definition of the derivative $f'(x)$ of a function $f(x)$ means.  Include both inline and numbered equations, as well as a proper title, abstract, and section headings. Find a suitable image to illustrate your definition online, and include it as a figure, with proper citation of the source. After ensuring that your LaTeX file compiles properly to pdf, commit only the source file ```testlatex.tex``` to GitHub.
1. Using ```vim``` in  a terminal, create a python file ```testpython.py```. In this file write only a single function ```test_trivial()``` that contains only the line ```assert True```. Commit this python file to GitHub and ensure that the Travis tests detect it and report a passing status. You will need to edit the links in README file and commit the changes to GitHub to see the Travis status image.

## Assessment

The assignment was very useful in getting us up to speed on the basics of vim, git and terminal. No questions all is well.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.
